# Income Redistribution Analysis

This project analyzes preferences for income redistribution using machine learning models, including **Logistic Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest**. The analysis evaluates both **predictive performance and interpretability**, highlighting challenges with class imbalance and model optimization.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **full_analysis.ipynb** → The main notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
- **combined_data.csv** → Raw dataset used for analysis.
- **cleaned_combined_data_1.csv** → Processed dataset after cleaning and feature selection.
- **updated_variable_list.csv** → Variables used in the study.
- **educational_level_table.png** → Visualization related to educational mobility.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Predictive modeling:** Logistic Regression struggled with class imbalance, while ensemble methods slightly improved classification.
- **Interpretive modeling:** Income, educational mobility, and trust in government were significant predictors of redistributive attitudes.
- **Future improvements:** Exploring non-linear models such as Neural Networks or tree-based methods may enhance accuracy.
